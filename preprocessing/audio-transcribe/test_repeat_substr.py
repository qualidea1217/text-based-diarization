One of the most popular ways to explore it is during a bike ride or walk along the famous seawall. Let's do lunch. Okay, so here's the pie. Can I help with anything? Yeah, that looks good. Hey, did you put the oven heating or did you put it off? No, I left it on. It's preheated. So all we got to do is brush it with egg white and then put it in. I think I use only the yolk, right? The recipe's on my computer. Is that how you do egg wash? Usually it's the yolk. Yeah, you have to whisk it though, right? Like fork? Great, thank you for experimenting with the food also. It'll be delicious. It'll be great. And if not, Cheetos for everyone. Yeah. That's why I put the Cheetos in. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Whisk cream and egg yolk in a small bowl. So one large egg yolk, one tablespoon heavy cream. They told me whipping cream's the same, right? Yeah, it's the same. I haven't actually seen heavy cream in Canada. I only see whipping cream. I'll be got heavy cream the other day. I got whipping cream. Really? They don't call it heavy cream. I had to ask random people in the grocery store. It's the same thing. Okay, so how do you do it with just the yolk? Last time I did it, I did it over the sink and then I carried it. That's right. Yeah, I'll just bring the bowl over to you if you want me to do it. Okay. And then one tablespoon. We have to eye because we don't have a tablespoon measuring things. You good? Yeah. You want a drink? Yeah, please. Okay. Iced tea? Of course you want that, correct? Iced tea. Pepsi. We have iced tea, Pepsi. Is that all we have? We have a V8. And we have iced tea. We can make a lemon. Do we have a lemonade still? Yeah, we've got a lemonade. We have water. Iced tea. Iced tea will work for me too. Okay. Two iced teas. Is it sugar and iced tea or just... I think so. Abby? Yeah, Jen? It's from one of the frozen cans so that makes me think yes. I'll have water. Okay. Do you want me to just put this in the garbage? Here, compost. Perfect. We've never composted. Cooper. Perfect. And then we have to do a tablespoon of... I like the eye. Yeah. That looks pretty good. Looks like a good tablespoon. Look, it's a yin yang. It's still... Let's put a dot in there. That's right. Well, whatever. We have a ginger beer too. You can also use a napkin and just... Really? Yeah. Just dip the napkin in it and wipe it off. I thought you meant to whisk it at first. Oh, no, no, no. Okay. The wash. Paper towel. I did something the other day with oil. I always forget to buy... I always forget to buy... Like, a cooking spray at the grocery store. Mm-hmm. And I often use paper towel with like, olive oil or butter and just wipe it off. That's awesome. So I assume eight washes is the same thing. Oh, sorry. No worries. Figuring things out. Good job. Oh, thanks. No, I'm just kidding. Put it in there. I'm a messy. Messy cook. Abby, you might have... No, no. I was going to say, Abby, you have to do something in the kitchen probably for a little bit. This is a lot. Yeah, you probably won't use it all. Really? Yeah, just like, wipe it, like... Yeah, like that. Yes, exactly. Like paint. My cooking skills. So Abby's like, are you sure you don't want me to cook? I'm like, Abby, I can cook. I just follow a recipe. Yes. It's kind of like painting it so that it turns out golden. Makes it flakier, too. It'll be pretty. What is it called? Oh, yeah. Should I use something bocconcini, which I didn't know was a type of... Okay, I think that's all. So I throw it in. It's fine to not use the rest of it. Yeah, you don't have to use the rest of it. Abby, you're saying just put it on the thing? It said use a rimmed baking sheet, but we don't have one. Just put it on? Just put it on foil if you want. No, foil's not going to make a difference. Where's my phone, John? It'll be on the table in front of you. Bye. I figure if we have to spend this time in the kitchen anyways, we'll put together something. You know what? If you want, I can cut up the desserts and put them in the fridge. I've got fruit, too. Oh, great. We have a side, and we've got lettuce and nuts to put together. Are there plates in here? Yes. Okay, cool. Which can you use, too? Scoop. Could I have a knife? Yes, I love it. We're going to cut the pies in. We're going to do the light side salad and fruit. And just chop stuff up. So you might just want to come in and out. We're not obeying the rules. We're supposed to be in the kitchen. Okay, we're going to come in. We're going to come in. Yeah, just sit at the table. Then you're near to the kitchen. If it gets hot, we can put the fan on you. Oh, that's fine. So you know the oven is... I got them. So I didn't get a response. But then we spoke to my aunt. We spoke to my aunt a few days ago. She used to do immigration law. But now she does translation services and refugee services. She's got a sort of apartment in Toronto. I don't know. I just cut these up. I cut them up, but I don't want them to look like two loaves. So I'm just going to mess them up. It's just applications. Yeah, of course. You can eat them or not. Would you guys prefer pre-made dressing or do you just want to do it? I'm going to do this one. We have a lemon too. Perfect. That tastes funny. Oh, damn. That is whistle. That's what we're doing. Why don't you put the big silver bowl? Big silver bowl? Because my wife is behind you. Oh, just kidding. Thanks. So I'm looking to get back to my aunt. Put us in touch with someone who is an expert on the Canadian process. Because we're going to do her apartment residency. So we're coming to chat with her. I got it. Do you want me to wrap it and turn it? Or just put it in the fridge? Your green card. I'll be with Rapid. I'm like you. He's not ruling the kitchen today. I actually just got another email. I actually just got another email this morning. Status update. There's no further action on your account. Does it affect you though? No. Because your other one is still active. My other one is permanent. I'm actually trying to downgrade my status. Is there anything else that needs chopping? We're going to expire in three months. We're going to reach 500 people. How do we do it on the left? The middle shelf. For us, for the States, it's a simple question. It's for your sister's wedding. We won't be able to pay her. Very good. Can I go open it? Are you just going to make it into a little salad? Yeah. Just a berry. Strawberry. What about some grapes? Oh yeah, that's right. I forgot I got the grapes. Second dress. Do you like your grapes chopped or whole? Halved. Halved. Okay. Do you have a cutting board? Of course. Right here. You've got to take the camera again. What kind of blows are we talking about? If she's done a good study. She's used this cabinet. Because of the fact that the last time that she wrote the American version of the exam. Oh, I see. She's studied three months for it. It depends on how fast you learn. Practice two weeks, or practice three weeks, or at least until. So that has to happen. One. The second is, she's specialized in home health. So she's been doing home health for the last three years. And this exam does all the aspects. Athletes. All the aspects which she's not practiced with. Spinal cord injury. Practice with the last three years. Stroke. The things that she has to go and refresh basically the entire entity of her education. It will be re-studied, basically. So it comes to the question of if it's worth it or not worth it. And my friend who's still getting failed the first two times, took it a third time and finally passed. He's a PT from America. And somebody just told me yesterday that the third time if you don't pass, you don't get to take it again. You're kidding. It's just one. You're not a good PT. Three and done. You should never pass. You will fail as a PT. You should never pass in the first place. So that makes me a little nervous too. That being said, the positive part about it, about this order and this side versus that side is you're simpler to do CPR. Which is CPR is the only way to get it apart from your situation. I like the pain in the stuff. It's gonna be a good course. Well, that part's a little. You know what, it's like what if you were to be cast on a reality TV show one day? That's true. I don't think I would ever do that. I was watching Bachelor at the Mental Hall last night and I was thinking the same thing. We watched it last night too. Oh, you could have watched it live. Yeah, we did. I don't remember why we didn't. I probably went to bed or something. We did get to have Dolly got it. She had mentioned it. We were engaged by that time. I was gonna ask how you make your dressing with just olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Slicing grapes. Yes. Is that a thing that people do? For salad. Fruit salad. Is that it? Then you can't choke on it. And you can just stab them with a fork easily. I will. It's a thing. I have the oil, vinegar, and salt. Do you slice orange salad? No, I don't slice beans usually. That's okay. We'll salt and pepper it ourselves. Never say never. It's in the oven already? It's in the oven. We should have an unusual dinner featuring sliced beans. You want mustard? No. Dijon? I'll make it one. Okay. Make it healthy. Okay, you want the oil, vinegar, you want the lemon or no? I'll do it. Okay. What's in the salad? Nothing. Just lettuce and we have cashews or peanuts. They're both fatty. Just lettuce? You're just doing lettuce? Yeah, because we're going to have fruit on the side. No, because we'll season that. Kind of a boring salad. It'll be delicious. Thanks. Well, there's the Pepsi. I was wondering where you put it. Do you want a sweet drink? Yeah, I think just water. Oh, yeah. Kayla? Yeah. What's the name of the park where you used to sit? Do you have the name of it? No. Do you know where Brogan's on? No. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you know what road it's on? It's like a county road, I thought. Oh, okay. Oh, maybe not. No, I don't. Because there's a parking lot station. What road is it on? It's on Page Road. No, that's not it. 63 sites. And she lives technically in Bryan. Oh, okay. Is it back there? Huh? Is that back there? Yeah. It's right next to College Station. It's just a little bit more country. If you can even get more country than College Station. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

It looks really good. Okay. I don't need that anymore. We could put out forks and knives. Napkins. We steal napkins from wherever we go. Not like from people's houses. Napkins everywhere. Do you prefer crisps or criss-crisps? I just find crisps fun. Or C as Dolly sometimes. That's what I get. It's so long to type, Christopher. C. You know, I just did the shorthand on my iPhone so that you could type. I type E-M-L and I won't email text in it. Oh, that's nice. I might have to get a mismatch. What happened to the calendar book? I changed it to August. But why is there a circle over here? I don't know. Summer bank holiday. I thought it was a cup. It does look like a cup of coffee or something. So basically... What, bud? I need to get Odd Man out. Do you want more chips, Christopher? Yes, please. Okay. Should we have barbecue? Ketchup I would. I like the ketchup ones too. Man, these are so cheap. $1.25 for the whole bag. What? I don't know. That's normally like a small bag of chips. Yeah. Probably means they're going to give us cancer. Maybe they're from the dollar store. Nice. He's like, first few days here. He went there and he's like, these chips are awesome. And now when we go to like Walmart or No Frills or wherever and I see a big bag of chips, I'm like, $3.50? Screw that. We're going back to the dollar store to get our $1.25 bag of good chips. What do you need? I'm trying to figure out what I want to make with the dressing. Just make it light and fresh. You want light and fresh? Yes, please. Okay. No cheese in the salad? No. All you don't want cheese in the salad? I don't care. We have some if you want. Okay. Okay, leave me alone now. Love you. We have the fat from the cashews. Okay, bye. And this way. You want a sweet salad or do you want a... We're going to have the fruit on the side, so I don't think it needs too much sweet. You're going to have fruit on the side of the meal or the fruit dessert? No, they picked up dessert from Finch's for us. Because you're not doing fruit and veggies for dessert? We're going to just have the fruit as a side. You're going to have a fruit side. Yes. I'm going into the kitchen to fulfill my contractual duties. You can tell Bobby. At least part of it. That's how you get it. Um... I'm going to mix that. I'm confused as to what I'm doing. Berries, steak, uh, honey, honey. Honey works. You guys watch Game of Thrones? No, I've never seen it. Never seen it? No. Do you watch Game of Thrones or no? What is that, a show? He's mean. No, he's never seen it. He's always watching. It's obvious looking in his eye, he might punch you. I understand we were having a conversation about Snapchat not being used. But I was like, where were you living? So good, you guys have been watching with Haley. Haley's like, can I start a season seven? Can you catch me up? I can't catch you up once you're serious. What's the story here? Oh. What, you mean you don't have a jar of papers? Story where? I don't know how to tell this story. This is how we keep our accounting. It's our accounting department. It's all our receipts. This is every receipt that we have. Since we came to Canada. Like for food and groceries? Everything. You get a receipt and put it in there? Why? I throw it out every month. But I do accounts, if I spend ten cents, I'll put it in a book. Wow, that's very organized. I know exactly the balance to the dollar in every single account. There are balance owed on every single credit card. You can get free QuickBooks. I know, but mine works that way. You can get free QuickBooks and upload straight from your bank statement. I agree, but I've just been habit. I've been doing that before the QuickBooks and I've been doing it. What about when you use cash? Then that's true. And we have four different cards. It's like my grandfather still writing letters. It's just some things that you're just used to. You're the receipt guy? No, no. I'll keep receipts forever and now I'm like, yeah, I'll... I mean, this is kind of useless. This is kind of useless because... Yeah, we can throw those out. We can throw those out. I just do it for the sake of doing it. But I'm just saying that I do my books every night. So every night, before I go to bed, every dollar spent, I know what's done, what needs to be done, if anything needs to be moved. Why do you know all that, Avi? I do that for my business. I do. Yeah, but since my life is my business right now because I'm poor. As you can see from my great apartment. But yeah, so now my life has taken on... No, no, but the funny thing is before, I had people that do my books for me. I do the same for the building of our home. Every expense I put... I created a whole bunch of chart of accounts because I use an accounting system for it. So I've got like a categorized every expense. I decide whether it's capital or whether it's op-ex. So mortgage is op-ex. It's op-ex. Operating expense. So I treat our home as if it's an operating business. So when I get a bill from the architect, I sort of consider that capital because I'm improving the value of the land by paying the architect to design the home, which is eventually going to improve the value. So I put the architecture invoice and call that capital contribution. Oh good, so you are as anal as I am. Oh yeah. So like a mortgage statement or a gas bill or an electricity bill, I consider, well, that's not really adding value to the property. That's not a capital expense. That's just an operating expense. So I put that in as well. The nice thing is with my product development stuff, I used to just be like, yeah, I'll pay there, I'll pay there, I'll pay there. And somebody told me a couple of years ago, you can get reimbursed for all that, especially if you're a startup, you can get tax write-offs and everything. So I had to go back and find all the papers, and now he's organized a whole Excel sheet for me. She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's like, yeah, I put a little bit of money into it. So the other day, when I got there, I started putting it, I was like, you spent $24,000, 81. I was like, she had no idea. I was like, what the ballpark? She's like, yeah, maybe like 10, 12 grand I did the books. I was like, that's 24 grand that we're after. I forgot about the patent. The patent is the big thing. So the brilliant thing about my beautiful girlfriend, which is incredible, which is incredible, she is the biggest watcher. She'll go, that's a dollar less, or that's two. She'll watch the money incredibly. That's how you know when to do chips. No, no. She will find a deal. She'll find a coupon. I've never used a coupon before in my life. She'll find a deal. She'll find incredibly. She'll find a way to set it. But her mathematics is not so good. So she'll go and save $2 a year, and then she'll go and have a $300 dinner. Sometimes they're not in parity. But I still save. But I love the fact that she still looks for that $2, $3. So it's amazing. Sometimes we have the argument. We'll be arguing about something at the grocery store. She'll be like, go that way. I'm like, no. I'm like, how much did you spend on your nails today, for God's sake? No, no, but I'm just saying. You have to save a dollar here. He's like, you just got your nails done for this. I'm like, how is that comparable? I'm like, well, you know what I mean? It's still saving an extra dollar. And this will last for over a month, almost. No, no, that's not my point. That's not my point. I'm just saying that. I try to find her a box for nails. The daily expense is less. I'm just saying that she does it because she loves doing it. It's amazing. And I grew up in a family where we didn't mind going out to dinner and using a coupon after. Where I'll be too bad. That would be the most shameful thing ever. To use a coupon? Oh, yeah. Was a restaurant once where you had to use the coupon so that you could? Right. Where I grew up, even if you had the coupon, you wouldn't use it. Oh, really? Yeah. Which way? Oh, that way. But now, we're in Texas. I started getting the H-E-B coupons. Now it became coupon, man. The last time, like, unemployed Ailey teach me how to save money. Teach me how to save money. How you make money. One of my first jobs in high school was a cashier at Albertsons, a grocery store chain. And they would have triple coupon, double triple coupon days every, like, once a month on Sundays or something. So whatever your coupon was, it was times two or times three? Yes. Wow. And there were, like, what I would call, like, just... Crazy couponers? Crazy couponers came in and one lady bought, it was like $600 worth of groceries, and she paid 53 cents. She should have been on that show. Yes. What's it called? Crazy couponing or something? Extreme couponing. Extreme couponing. They were just, they were so good at it, they had little books. And I just couldn't... You don't necessarily get food you want, I think, when they do that. Yeah, I think it's like a lot of people. Like, it's like a lot of people pay to add 10. Yeah, that's true. About a 10-pack of pasta. Yeah, exactly. Take care of your own spaghetti again. And she's like, the fruit roll-ups are on sale. Limit 12, I'll get all 12. Like, you don't need 12 boxes of fruit roll-ups. I was at the grocery store yesterday taking the husks of corn, and they had about 50 husks of corn in their cart. Yeah, but they were also in a grocery store in the east. Yeah, it was a nice... But it was a nice grocery store. It was nice. I guess if they were on sale, you can freeze corn too. Oh. You can like, chuck it, boil it. Freeze it? I don't think they were even on sale. Oh. Yeah, because I mean, actually, frozen corn is really cheap over at the Indian place. Like, 97 cents. Yeah, that's true. You don't have to buy it. Well, it's hard to think, like, I wonder if they're like, going to stack up some, like, shelter or something like that. Oh, I see. I just opened that. Oh. Forks. Do you guys like big forks or little forks? I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork kind of guy. Okay. And I'll be the big fork. I'm the only little fork. My mom stops. You're okay with the white plate? That was actually my Hot or Not profile. Hot or Not profile? I'm a big fork. You're a big fork. That's cute. No. Haze? That's not. How long before lunch are you ready? Thirteen minutes for that. We can put the salad on. If you like big forks, look no further. That's actually kind of good. So we actually met online. On Hot or Not. Who met? We did meet on Hot or Not. You guys met on Hot or Not? Yes, in 2007. I haven't heard of Hot or Not in so long. What? I swear to God. In 2007, we were on Hot or Not. That's a precursor to Hot or Not. That's a precursor to Hot or Not. I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork. I'm a big fork. I swear to God. It's a precursor to Hot or Not. In 2007, we were on Hot or Not. That was one. On Hot or Not. I thought Hot or Not was a mock site. Because we used to make fun of Hot or Not when we were kids. No, no, no. You could. So, I don't know. You could. Hot or Not is just a rating site. Yeah. Yeah, that's the Hot or Not I remember. Yeah, so. Because you just go. That is not Hot or Not. So then in 2007, they were like, meet this person. And you could click. And then the man came. And it was yes or no. It was just, it was before mobile phones came out. Yes, it was like early iPhone. It was before the iPhone. And so instead there was just two buttons. Yes, no. So, I'm sure it's just like. You're at a crazer. Yeah, I'm sure it's just like what Tinder's like. Yeah. Where you just go and like, no, no. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. So, where was your first date? Central Park. Central Park. That's cute. Yeah. Afternoon, evening? Morning. Morning. We did like coffee. You can't go to Central Park in a pumpkin suit. No, I have to be in here. That's why. Yeah, you know. Where's my story back? Where's my story back? I'm going to be in here. I'm going to be in here. I'm going to be in here. Where's my story back? Where's my story back? Where's my story back? I met her on Hotterdot and I invited her to Central Park at night instead. And his thing was, do you like big forking? Well, what I was going to say was, back in 2007 you would chat on AIM before you like met someone. Yeah. And so his screen name was G-I-A-N-C, Junkie. And I read it originally as giant junk. Which it not was. What is G-I-A-N-C? Okay. This is super normal. Okay. I expect no less. G-I-A-N-C is a software company that makes aftermarket engine software for Audis. Okay. And so if you're an Audi owner and an Audi enthusiast, you're going to want to know what's going on. And so I'm going to be talking about that. And I'm going to be talking about the story of how I met her. And I'm going to be talking about the story of how I met her.
